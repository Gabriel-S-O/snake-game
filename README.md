Learning some reinforcement learning using pygame and pytorch with a classic snake game :D

# Seriously? another python snake game..

Yeah.. but i'll try to add some features to make this a bit challenging to the AI, like:

* **The devil's fruit**
>Reduces by the half your size (and your points as well!!)

* **The golden fruit**
>Increases 5 "squares" in your size and give some points

### *Both of them will spawn randomly during the playthrough*

>It's on purpose not fair :D, i want to see how the AI will deal with this.
